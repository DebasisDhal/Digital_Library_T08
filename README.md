# DigitalLibrary

# I developed the DigitalLibrary using the following technologies:

1. Angular for the framework
2. TypeScript for strong typing and scalable code
3. Chart.js for data visualization with charts
4. Bootstrap for responsive UI and styling
5. CSS and HTML for custom styling and structure

[Design.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18186494/Design.pdf)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
